### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

#### [German-Quiz-Game](https://github.com/awa03/German-Quiz-Game):
German Quiz Master is a simple yet effective quiz game designed to help you study for your German class using Dear PyGUI and Python. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an advanced learner looking to polish your skills, this interactive game offers an engaging way to practice German vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension.

#### [Do Not Resusitate](https://github.com/amm18z/Do_Not_Resuscitate): 
A game made for my Software Engineering course. This game aims to combine aspects of tower defense games, while fitting a medical theme. The goal of this project is to demonstrate our groups proficency in planning and developing a project from scratch. This project was made in the Unity engine, utalizing packages such as Cinamachine. This project has a goal completion date of December 2023. My contributions range from: creating UML models for development, creating artwork using pixel art software, creating the movement system, as well as many other features within the game. 

#### [Computer-Science-Notes](https://github.com/awa03/Computer-Science-Notes)
This repository is a collection of the majority of my notes as a computer science student. I challenged myself to create a user friendly platform in which the notes can be viewed. In the process of creating this site I learned Jerkyll as well as mark down syntax. I have been using Obsidian for my note taking for the last year and a half, but felt as though I wanted to be able to access my notes from anywhere, without dealing with downloading the files or viewing them in github (Previously FSU Notes repo). My solution was to create a static site in which the user can view the notes from. Within these notes I have also included notes from my self studying. 

#### [Canvas](https://github.com/awa03/Canvas)
I have been taking on the project of recreating the popular school grade application canvas. Through this project I hope to gain expirence in C#, as well as maui, and the REST API. This project will be most first fully fledged fullstack application, and I am excited to continue the development in the future.
