#### Do Not Resusitate: 
A game made for my Software Engineering course. This game aims to combine aspects of tower defense games, while fitting a medical theme. The goal of this project is to demonstrate our groups proficency in planning and developing a project from scratch. This project was made in the Unity engine, utalizing packages such as Cinamachine. This project has a goal completion date of December 2023. My contributions range from: creating UML models for development, creating artwork using pixel art software, creating the movement system, as well as many other features within the game.

I am the sole developer working on the development of this software. The primary goal of this project is to automate the seamless conversion of forms into a spreadsheet. It is being crafted for a specific company, showcasing my expertise in utilizing the Google Cloud API.

#### Maze Solving
I have been having fun working with maze solving algorithms as of late, so I decided to challenge myself to visualize them. I used python and the required librarys in order to complete this task. The mazes can be built and tested by the user.
